short: converting a str to a LPWSTR
---

## first things first
One of the first things you encounter when writing code for win api is that your strings need to be null terminated wide char, basically u16 terminated with a \0 and line breaks use both \r\n escape characters.

How about some code
``` rust
// first we need to include the OsString lib
use std::os::windows::ffi::{OsStrExt,OsStringExt};
use std::ffi::{OsStr,OsString};

// then we'll try a function that converts a &str
// to a utf16 wide string in a Vec<u16> and
// then appends a null termination

fn to_wstring(s : &str) -> Vec<u16> {
        OsStr::new(s).encode_wide().chain(Some(0).into_iter()).collect::<Vec<u16>>()
 }

// windows mostly uses long pointer to wide strings
// so all we have to do now is use the function as_ptr()

fn main(){
let test = "hello";
let wide = to_wstring(test);
// and now if we want to return a LPWSTR , pointer that windows uses
// all we have to do is..
let lpwstr = wide.as_ptr();

// even simpler is to write
let lpwstr =  to_wstring("hello").as_ptr();
// but this approach might not always work, it's much safer
// to use the let binding before making it a pointer
// just so it won't end up pointing at nothing

}
```
just for fun we might try to turn this into a trait

~~~ rust

pub trait FromStr{
    fn to_wstring(&self)->Vec<u16>;
    
}
impl FromStr for &str{
    fn to_wstring(&self)->Vec<u16>{
        OsStr::new(self).encode_wide().chain(Some(0).into_iter()).collect::<Vec<u16>>()
    }
    
}
