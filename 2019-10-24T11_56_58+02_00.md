## first things first
One of the first things you encounter when writing code for win api is that your strings need to be null terminated wide char, basically u16 terminated with a \0 and line breaks use both \r\n escape characters.

How about some code
``` rust
// first we need to include the OsString lib
use std::os::windows::ffi::{OsStrExt,OsStringExt};
use std::ffi::{OsStr,OsString};

// then we'll try something

fn to_wstring(s : &str) -> Vec<u16> {
        OsStr::new(s).encode_wide().chain(Some(0).into_iter()).collect()
 }
```
